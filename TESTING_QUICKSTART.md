# Quick Start: Testing Setup

## 1. Prerequisites Check
```bash
# Verify you're in the project directory
pwd
# Should show: .../berry-free-react-admin-template/vite

# Check Node and Yarn versions
node --version  # Should be v18+
yarn --version  # Should be 4.x
```

## 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

## 3. Run Your First Test
```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Or run with UI (recommended first time)
yarn test:ui
```

## 4. Expected Output
```
 âœ“ src/tests/api/workspaceAPI.test.js (8)
   âœ“ workspaceAPI.deleteWorkspace (8)
     âœ“ should successfully delete a workspace
     âœ“ should verify correct API endpoint is called
     âœ“ should handle 404 error when workspace not found
     âœ“ should handle 403 error when user lacks permission
     âœ“ should handle network errors gracefully
     âœ“ should handle invalid workspace ID format
     âœ“ should handle server error (500)
     âœ“ should use correct API key in headers

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  8 passed (8)
```

## 5. Test Commands Cheat Sheet
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `yarn test` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `yarn test:run` | Run tests once (CI/CD) |
| `yarn test:ui` | Interactive test UI |
| `yarn test:coverage` | Generate coverage report |

## 6. File Structure Created
```
vite/
â”œâ”€â”€ vitest.config.js          # Vitest configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ setup.js          # Test setup & mocks
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # Full documentation
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ workspaceAPI.test.js  # Delete endpoint tests
```

## 7. Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Cannot find module"
```bash
yarn install
```

### Issue: Tests hanging
Press `q` to quit watch mode, then:
```bash
yarn test:run
```

### Issue: Port already in use (for UI)
Kill the process on port 51204 or let Vitest auto-assign a new port.

## 8. Next Steps
1. âœ… Run the test suite
2. Open `src/tests/api/workspaceAPI.test.js` to see test examples
3. Add tests for other endpoints (copy the pattern)
4. Read `src/tests/README.md` for detailed documentation

## 9. Pro Tips
- Use `yarn test:ui` for visual debugging
- Press `f` in watch mode to run only failed tests
- Press `p` to filter by filename pattern
- Use `describe.only()` or `it.only()` to run specific tests

## 10. Verify Everything Works
```bash
# Quick verification
yarn test:run

# Should pass all 8 tests
# If any fail, check your API setup
```
